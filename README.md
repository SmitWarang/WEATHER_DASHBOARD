## Project Overview  
The Weather Dashboard is a responsive and user-friendly weather application built using React and Vite. It allows users to search for real-time weather information of any city worldwide using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app fetches and displays essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions while providing an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface.  

This project is designed to be lightweight, fast, and efficient, leveraging Vite's optimized build process. It also includes a clean UI with smooth interactions, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.  

## Key Features  

### Search Functionality  
- Users can enter a city name in the search bar to get real-time weather updates.  
- The app intelligently handles input validation, ensuring users receive meaningful feedback if an invalid city is entered.  

### Live Weather Data  
- The app integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display accurate weather data.  
- Displays essential weather details such as:  
  - Temperature (°C)  
  - Humidity (%)  
  - Weather Conditions (e.g., "Cloudy", "Sunny", "Rainy")  

### Responsive & Modern UI  
- The app features a minimalist and clean design, making it easy to use.  
- A gradient background dynamically enhances the aesthetic.  
- The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries.  

### Optimized Performance  
- Built with Vite, which offers faster build times and optimized performance compared to traditional React setups.  
- Uses React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for efficient state management.

### Error Handling  
- Displays clear error messages if a city is not found.  
- Prevents unnecessary API calls if the input field is empty.  

## Tech Stack Used  

- Frontend: React (with Vite)  
- Styling: CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)  
- API Integration: OpenWeatherMap API  
- State Management: React Hooks (`useState`)  
- Dependency Management: npm  
- Icons: React Icons (optional)  

## How It Works  

1. The user enters a city name into the input field and clicks the "Search" button.  
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.  
3. If the city exists, the app displays the temperature, humidity, and weather condition.  
4. If the city is not found, an error message is displayed.  

## Future Enhancements 
 - 5-Day Forecast: Add an extended weather forecast.
 - Dark Mode: Implement a theme toggle for better UX.
 - Auto Location Detection: Fetch user’s location-based weather.
